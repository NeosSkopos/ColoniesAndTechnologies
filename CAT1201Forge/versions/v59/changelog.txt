Comments/Thoughts:
+ The replacement of Just Enough Guns for Vic's Point Blank was due to multiple reasons. Vic's just feels more simple and straight forward with its crafting ingredients and more customisations with the attachments. But primarily, it has impact grenades and even a rocket launcher (which I missed, since removal of Missile Mahem). Though it had a lot of cool stuff, I just found myself using bows more than the JEG guns, because bows were just stronger and easier to get to.
+ Since removing the Rotted mod, the game hasn't felt that challenging anymore. I hope the adding of Farsighted Mobs can help to slightly make the difficulty more enjoyable (more action) now, without making mobs themselves much harder.
+ The Hook mod, as a grappling hook, is far simpler in its usage and slot requirements, hence replacing Advanced Hook Launchers with it.
+ Also, my friend lost (dropped) his special axe in the Nether by accidentally pressing "q", so I think it's about time I added some protection against that.
