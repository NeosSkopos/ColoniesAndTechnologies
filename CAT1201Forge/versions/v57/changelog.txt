Comments/Thoughts:
- EMI was starting to cause VERY slow opening times on the first time someone opens their inventory - even crashing the game sometimes. Since JEI is already installed as well, it was time for me to let go of EMI, even though I prefer it more than JEI.
- Also kept getting crashes that reset all keybinds. I think this was related to ImmediatelyFast's latest update, not actually being intended for 1.20.1, but for 1.21. After reverting that. Things were better.
- The above also made me re-add Default Options, because with that you can "Reset All" your keybinds to the modpack defaults. (Not reliable on 1.20.1 for preserving your own options though, so only added for the Reset All usefulness.)
- Block placements/removals are now way faster with Pro Placer added, but I still kept the bridging mod for wrap-around block placements, because Pro Placer doesn't support placing things below blocks.
- I thought the villages from Luki's Grand Capitals were epicâ€¦ yet the Integrated Villages mod topped even that!
