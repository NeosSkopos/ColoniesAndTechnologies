Comments/Thoughts:
+ The Jobs+ Remastered mod kept crashing clients when changing abilities on dedicated servers. Although I liked the mod, I don't enjoy having a frequent crashing experience and the Improvable Skills mod seems to fill the space better by also having a link to the abilities in the inventory.
+ Starting to add a Beastiary quests section, which tries to teach which creatures can be tamed, how to tame them and what can be done with them.
